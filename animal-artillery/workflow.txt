Let's reprocess and consolidate the complete project workflow based on our discussions:

## 🎯 **REVISED PROJECT WORKFLOW**

### **PHASE 1: FOUNDATION (Week 1-2)**
**Current Status: COMPLETED ✅**

**What We Built:**
- Standard Phaser project structure
- Responsive game canvas (fullscreen)
- Basic physics world with gravity
- 3 animal placeholders (cat, dog, duck)
- Keyboard input system
- Auto-resizing for all devices

**Files Structure:**
```
animal-artillery/
├── index.html          # Entry point
├── css/style.css       # Fullscreen styling
├── js/
│   ├── main.js         # Phaser config & game init
│   ├── scenes/
│   │   ├── Boot.js     # Quick scene starter
│   │   └── Game.js     # Main game logic
├── assets/             # (Empty for now)
└── lib/                # Phaser library
```

### **PHASE 2: CORE GAMEPLAY (Week 3-6)**
**Next Priority Features:**

#### **Week 3: Turn-Based System**
```
IMPLEMENT:
- Player turn management
- Character selection
- Turn timer
- Game state machine

CODE LOCATION:
Game.js → new methods:
  startTurn()
  endTurn() 
  switchPlayer()
```

#### **Week 4: Character Movement**
```
IMPLEMENT:
- Limited movement per turn
- Jump/walk mechanics
- Terrain collision
- Movement boundaries

NEW FILES:
js/entities/Character.js - Base character class
```

#### **Week 5: Weapon System**
```
IMPLEMENT:
- Weapon selection UI
- Projectile physics
- Aiming trajectory
- Damage calculation

NEW FILES:
js/entities/Weapon.js
js/entities/Projectile.js
```

#### **Week 6: Destructible Terrain**
```
IMPLEMENT:
- Simple terrain destruction
- Explosion effects
- Collision with terrain
- Basic particle effects

NEW FILES:
js/systems/TerrainSystem.js
```

### **PHASE 3: POLISH (Week 7-8)**
**Visual & Audio Enhancement:**
- Animal sprites (replace circles)
- Sound effects
- UI polish
- Mobile touch controls

### **PHASE 4: ADVANCED FEATURES (Week 9+)**
**Stretch Goals:**
- Multiple weapons
- AI opponents
- Level progression
- Online features

## 🔄 **DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW PROCESS**

### **Daily Development Cycle:**
```
PLAN → CODE → TEST → COMMIT → REPEAT
```

**For Each Feature:**
1. **Plan**: Discuss approach here first
2. **Code**: Implement in small chunks
3. **Test**: Save + refresh browser frequently
4. **Debug**: Use console.log() and browser tools
5. **Refine**: Adjust based on testing

### **File Modification Workflow:**
```
1. Identify which file needs changes
2. Make small, testable changes
3. Save file (Ctrl+S)
4. Refresh browser (F5) 
5. Verify feature works
6. Repeat until complete
```

## 🎮 **CURRENT CODE STATUS**

**What's Working Now:**
```javascript
// In Game.js - You have:
create() {
  setupWorld()        // Physics bounds & ground
  createAnimals()     // 3 colored circles
  setupInput()        // SPACE, UP, ENTER keys
  addInstructions()   // UI text
}
```

**Next Logical Step:** Turn-based character control

## 📋 **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS**

### **Option A: Turn-Based System**
Replace free movement with turn-based controls:
- Only active character can move
- Turn timer
- Player switching

### **Option B: Visual Upgrade**  
Add proper animal sprites:
- Download/create character images
- Replace colored circles
- Add simple animations

### **Option C: Weapon Prototype**
Add basic shooting:
- Click to aim
- Launch projectile
- Simple collision

## ❓ **DECISION POINT**

**Which direction do you want to go next?**
1. **Turn-based mechanics** (core gameplay)
2. **Visual upgrade** (better graphics)
3. **Weapon system** (combat mechanics)
4. **Something else?**

The turn-based system would be the most impactful next step since it's the core of your Worms-like game.
